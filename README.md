## Security Notes

- ESPN credentials (SWID and ESPN_S2) are session-based and expire periodically
- Never share your ESPN_S2 token as it provides access to your ESPN account
- The application only uses credentials to fetch league data, no data is stored server-side

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No working cookie format found"**
   - Your ESPN_S2 token may have expired
   - Try refreshing your ESPN session and getting new credentials

2. **"ESPN API returned 401"**
   - League may be private and requires authentication
   - Verify your SWID and ESPN_S2 credentials are correct

3. **"Team not found"**
   - Check that your League ID and Year are correct
   - Ensure the team exists in the specified league

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Use the "Test Credentials" button to verify your ESPN access
2. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
